# PyDoll MCP Server v1.5.15 Release Notes

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed Pydantic Model Method Call Error
- **Issue**: `AttributeError: 'OperationResult' object has no attribute 'to_dict'`
- **Cause**: Incorrect method call on Pydantic models
- **Solution**: Replaced all `result.to_dict()` calls with the correct `result.dict()` method
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `pydoll_mcp/tools/file_tools.py` (8 occurrences)
  - `pydoll_mcp/tools/network_tools.py` (10 occurrences)
  - `pydoll_mcp/tools/protection_tools.py` (12 occurrences)

### Fixed Tab ID Handling
- **Issue**: `Tab None not found in browser` errors
- **Cause**: Some handlers were passing `tab_id=None` to `get_tab()` instead of using proper fallback
- **Solution**: Updated screenshot handler to use `get_tab_with_fallback()` which properly handles None tab_id
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `pydoll_mcp/tools/screenshot_tools.py`

### Fixed PyDoll API Compatibility
- **Issue**: `Tab.take_screenshot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'full_page'`
- **Cause**: MCP Server was passing unsupported parameters to PyDoll's `take_screenshot` method
- **Solution**: Updated to only use supported parameters: `path`, `quality`, and `as_base64`
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `pydoll_mcp/tools/screenshot_tools.py`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### PyDoll API Alignment
- Removed unsupported screenshot parameters (`full_page`, `type`, `clip`)
- Now uses `as_base64=True` to get screenshot data for processing
- Maintains backward compatibility with MCP tool interface

### Error Handling Improvements
